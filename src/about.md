Hey there! I'm Chris Williams. I'm a senior software engineer working for Atlassian.

I'm also a proud daddy!

## Work Experience

### Senior Software Engineer @ Atlassian (Apr 2020 -> Today)

I currently work within the Ecosystem Deployments team at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlassian</a>. We own the experience of deploying <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forge</a> apps - the in-product app experience for third-party developers and internal integrations.

### Engineering Team Lead @ Escrow.com (2017 -> 2019)

I led a team of engineers working on constant improvements to the site and its backend services. Notably, I led the development of the first iteration of the modern <a href="https://www.escrow.com/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Escrow Platform API</a>. I also led the migration of the Microsoft SQL Server database to support unicode, an involved process that involved scripts, safeguards, and detailed change management.

### Software Engineer @ Escrow.com (2016)

I started my career as a full stack developer from backend work (mainly C#, Python and SQL Server) to frontend work (ReactJS).

## Education

### BE in Mechatronics Engineering @ University of New South Wales (2010-2015)

Graduating with First Class Honours, I found my core strength was in software development, excelling in computer science elective courses and automation involving MATLAB and C++.
